# CSTS: Exploring Class-specific and Task-shared Embedding Representation for Few-shot Learning in One Line of Code
(accepted to TNNLS 2024).

PyTorch implementation of 

**CSTS achieves new state-of-the-art performance on several few-shot learning benchmarks with significant advantages. The result is obtained without using any extra data for training or testing.**
